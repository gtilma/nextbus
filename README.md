# nextbus

An exercise in creating a minimum viable product. Not to be used for anything but experimentation.

This tool uses the GTFS data supplied by Capital Metro in Austin, TX to retrieve the next four departures for a given stop and route.

GTFS data can be obtained from [CapMetro](https://data.texas.gov/download/r4v4-vz24/application/zip).

`data/table_schema.sql` can be used to prepare the `mysql` database & tables.
